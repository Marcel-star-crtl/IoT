## Introduction 
Tried making a simple registration portal today. Like everything these days, not all ideas are mine


## Requirements :heavy_check_mark:
* [python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)
* pip
* [kivy 2.1.0](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) (currently master branch)
* [kivyMD 1.0.2](https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD) (currently master branch)
* [sweetalert](https://github.com/kivymd-extensions/sweetalert)

Note: To install all at once, a `requirements.txt` file is present in the main directory. You could use the following command in your virtual environment:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Installation :memo:
Before everything, it is recommended to setup a new virtual environment. Check how to do this [here](https://gist.github.com/dreamorosi/e2947827e5de92b69df68c88475eba38) if you have no idea.

Clone this repository directly([how to](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)) or download it as a zip file(remember to extract the files). 

* enter the main directory from your IDE or using the bash command
```bash
cd Login-and-Registration-Portal
```

## Usage :memo:
Run the `main.py` file from your IDE or terminal to get started.
```bash
python main.py
```
## Screenshots :camera:
_To be added..._


## RoadMap :dart:
How far have I gone:
- [x] Login section
- [x] Registration section
